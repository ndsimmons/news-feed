# News Feed Project Status

## ✅ Completed Setup

### Database Configuration
- **D1 Database Created**: `news-feed-db`
- **Database ID**: `8a170cc9-10c1-4996-801d-c0e5ab4c15f4`
- **Schema**: ✅ Migrated (local + remote)
- **Seed Data**: ✅ Loaded (local + remote)

### KV Namespace
- **KV Namespace Created**: `news-feed-kv`
- **Namespace ID**: `6a1dd252ef6e47a39dbb338443f4e264`

### Configuration Files
- ✅ `wrangler.toml` configured with D1 and KV IDs
- ✅ `.env.example` created for API keys
- ✅ All configuration committed to GitHub

### Database Contents

**Categories (4 total)**:
1. Tech/AI
2. Business/Finance
3. Sports
4. Politics

**Active Sources (4 total)**:
1. Techmeme (RSS) - Tech/AI
2. Stratechery (RSS) - Tech/AI
3. Yahoo Finance (RSS) - Business/Finance
4. CNBC (RSS) - Business/Finance

**Inactive Sources** (require API keys):
- X (Tech)
- Sofascore
- Wide World of News
- 2way
- X (Politics)

## 🚀 Ready to Run

### Local Development

Start the Astro dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit: http://localhost:4321

### Testing the Fetcher

To manually fetch articles from RSS feeds:
```bash
# Deploy the fetcher first
wrangler deploy workers/fetcher.ts --name news-feed-fetcher

# Then trigger it
curl -X POST https://news-feed-fetcher.YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev/api/fetch-now
```

Or wait for the cron job (runs every hour).

### Deploying to Production

1. **Deploy the API Worker**:
```bash
wrangler deploy workers/api.ts --name news-feed-api
```

2. **Deploy the Fetcher Worker**:
```bash
wrangler deploy workers/fetcher.ts --name news-feed-fetcher
```

3. **Build and Deploy Astro Site**:
```bash
npm run build
wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name news-feed
```

## 📊 Current State

### What Works
- ✅ Database schema and seed data
- ✅ All React components built
- ✅ Scoring algorithm implemented
- ✅ RSS parser ready
- ✅ API endpoints coded
- ✅ Techmeme-inspired UI styled
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts (← →)
- ✅ Mouse drag voting
- ✅ Category filtering

### What Needs Testing
- ⏳ Worker deployment
- ⏳ Article fetching from RSS feeds
- ⏳ API connectivity between frontend and Workers
- ⏳ Voting functionality
- ⏳ Recommendation algorithm with real data

### What Needs API Keys (Optional)
- Twitter/X API (for tech and politics feeds)
- Sofascore API (for sports)
- Mark Halperin's Wide World of News (needs research)
- 2way (needs research)

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Test Locally)
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:4321
3. Check if UI loads correctly
4. Deploy workers to test API integration

### Short Term (Deploy)
1. Deploy Workers to Cloudflare
2. Configure Cloudflare Pages
3. Connect frontend to Workers API
4. Test article fetching
5. Verify voting system works

### Medium Term (Enhance)
1. Add Twitter API integration
2. Add more RSS sources
3. Implement search functionality
4. Add bookmarking/save feature
5. Email digest feature

### Long Term (Scale)
1. Multi-user authentication
2. Mobile app (React Native)
3. Advanced ML recommendations
4. Social sharing features
5. Dark mode

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Workers not deployed yet** - Need to deploy workers/api.ts and workers/fetcher.ts
2. **Frontend can't connect to API yet** - Workers need to be deployed first
3. **No articles in database yet** - Need to run fetcher to populate articles

## 📝 Notes

- All code is committed to GitHub: https://github.com/ndsimmons/news-feed
- Database is configured for both local and remote (production)
- RSS feeds are active and ready to fetch
- Algorithm starts with neutral weights (1.0) for all sources
- Weights adjust by ±10% per vote
- Articles older than 7 days are not shown in feed
- Fresh articles (< 2 hours) get a 50% boost
